dont tell me how you knew it would be like this all along
i know the truth is you wont love me until im gone
and even then the thing that comes after is movin on
i cant even capture the feeling i had at first
meetin all my heroes like seein how magic works
the people i look up to are goin from bad to worse
their actions out of character even when they rehearse
workin in the land of the free the home of the brave
i gotta bring my brothers or else i feel out of place
breakin speed records on roads that these niggas paved
and they dont like that its written all on they face
i dont know how ima make it out of here clean
cant even keep track of who plays for the other team
iconic duos rip and split at the seams
goodhearted people are takin it to extremes
leavin me in limbo to question what i believe
leavin me to ask whats their motive in makin peace
leavin me to not trust anybody i meet
leavin me to ask is there anybody like me
youve got me fe–
you ohhhh
youve got me fe–
you ohhhh ayy
missin out on my years
theres times when i wish i was where i was
back when i used to wish i was here
missin out on my days
scrollin through life and fishin for praise
opinions from total strangers take me out of my ways
i try and see whos there on the other end of the shade
most times its just somebody thats underaged
thats probably just alone and afraid
and lashin out so that someone else can feel they pain
i always hear people complain about the place that they live
that all the people here are fake and they got nothin to give
cause they been starin at somebody elses version of shit
that makes another city seem more excitin than it is
i know a girl whose one goal was to visit rome
then she finally got to rome
and all she did was post pictures for people at home
cause all that mattered was impressin everybody shes known
i know another girl thats cryin out for help
but her latest caption is leave me alone
i know a girl happily married til she puts down her phone
i know a girl that saves pictures from places shes flown
to post later and make it look like she still on the go
look at the way we live
i wasnt hidin my kid from the world
i was hidin the world from my kid
from empty souls who just wake up and look to debate
until you starin at your seed you can never relate
breakin news in my life i dont run to the blogs
the only ones i wanna tell are the ones i can call
they always ask why let the story run if its false
you know a wise man once said nothin at all
im exhausted and drained i cant even pretend
all these people takin miles when you give em an inch
all these followers but who gon follow me to the end
i guess ill make it to the end and ima find out then
youve got me fe–
you ohhhh ayy
higher higher
youve got me fe–
you ohhhh ayy
higher higher

yachts on the 4th of july g5 soarin the skies
is there more to life than all of these corporate ties
and all of these fortunate times
and all of these asses that never come in proportionate size
am i missin somethin thats more important to find
like healin my soul like family time
is there more to life than just when im feelin alive
is there more

you know hun im a bit concerned about this negative tone that im hearing in your voice these days i can appreciate where your uncertainty stems from and you have reason to question your anxieties and how disillusioned you feel as well as feeling skeptical about who you believe you can trust but that attitude will just hold you back in this life and youre going to continue to feel alienated give some thought to this because i’m confident in you and i know you can reach your desired destination and accomplish your goals much more quickly without this confrontation im hearing in your tone these days when others go low we go high
<DRAKE>

that’s not respectable all of a sudden
i don’t get a pat on the back for the come up
what do you see when you see me
when did all the things i mean
from the bottom of my heart start to lose meaning
maybe i share it with too many people
back then it used to just feel like our secret
back when i would write and not think about how they receive it
i be tryna manifest the things i needed
and look now i mean its hard to believe it even for me
but youre mindful of it all when your mind full of it all
how they go from not wantin me at all
to wantin to see me lose it all
things get dark but my aura just starts glowin
im overcome with emotions
ones i cant access when im stoned sober
jealous ones still envy and niggas turn king cobra
i could only speak what i know of
man we wrote the book on calculated thinkin
and icy heineken drinkin and rival neighborhoods linkin
and puttin your trust in someone with the risk of financially sinkin
all you did was write the book on garbageass rollies
ego strokin picture postin
claimin that youd do it for motivational purposes only
but you just had to show me
see i know cause i study you closely
i know when someone lyin
i notice people standin for nothin and gettin tired
i know what were both thinkin even when youre quiet
sometimes i gotta just make sure that i didnt lose you

certain people need to tell me theyre proud of me
that mean a lot to me
not havin closure it take a lot out of me
this year for christmas i just want apologies
sydney gave up on me when i went missin
syn had a baby and treated me different
erika sued me and opened a business
wonder if they wish it couldve been different
wonder what theyd do put in my position
i wonder when my shit drop do they listen
wonder if theyre second guessin their decisions
i hate the number 2 that shit is unforgiven
tryna satisfy everybody
its like they cant get enough
until enough is enough
and then its too much
you tip the scale when i weigh my options
west palm girls are spoiled rotten
tiffany on you you know you poppin
ill kill somebody if they give you problems
master bedrooms where we get it poppin
just ignore all the skeletons in my closet
im a walkin comeup im a bank deposit
sell my secrets and get top dollar
sell my secrets for a range rover
opportunity and temptation
they would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation
sell my secrets back to me if i was payin
whos gonna save me when i need savin
since take care ive been caretakin
but second chances that aint how you livin
redemption on your mind ill never be forgiven
yeah
i know
<DRAKE>
yeah thats right yeah
<DRAKE>
always saw you for what you couldve been
ever since you met me
like when chrysler made that one car
that looked just like the bentley
i always saw you for what you couldve been
and even when its business with you its personal again
i knew you before you made ends meet
and now were meeting our end
and its all because you chose a side
youre supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
guess it wasnt time yeah
and of course you went and chose a side that wasnt mine
youre so predictable i hate people like you
kennedy road taught me not to trust people like you
how you supposed to figure out what im going through
you cant even figure out whats going on with you
you judge me fore you met me yeah it figures
i make all the players anthems for the real niggas
with my dad out in tennessee is where i belong
out here in la i dont know whats going on
i dont know whats going on
and its all because you chose a side
youre supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
guess it wasnt time yeah
and of course you went and chose a side that wasnt mine
you sit and you pray hoping that the stars align
my luck is a sure thing cause im living right
when i needed you you couldnt give me any advice
but you always had something to say every other time
everybody that i met on the way tries to get in the way
im fooding and serving them all
like im working for minimum wage
someone up there must just love testing my patience
someone up there must be in need of some entertainment
forgiveness for your ways
if i ever loved ya ill always love ya thats how i was raised
same way im right here still feeling the way
same way im realizing on a day to day that
any time people want to start problems
its like “for real are you dumb”
you know who mans are
im not afraid no gyal heart man
and im not afraid of no cyattie
and im not afraid of no waste yute neither
so anybody who want it can get it
seh feh
